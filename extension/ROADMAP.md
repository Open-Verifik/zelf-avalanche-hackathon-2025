# üöÄ ZelfKeys Development Roadmap & Grant Proposal
## Building the Future of Decentralized Digital Asset Management on Avalanche

---

## üìã Executive Summary

ZelfKeys represents a revolutionary breakthrough in privacy-preserving password management, leveraging our proprietary **ZelfProof** technology to create the world's first truly private, biometric-based password manager. Unlike traditional password managers that store encrypted data on centralized servers, ZelfKeys uses zero-knowledge face proofs that never store biometric data, ensuring complete privacy while maintaining maximum security.

Our MVP, developed during the Avalanche Hackathon 2025, demonstrates the core ZelfProof concept: **350-byte encrypted proofs that can only be decrypted by the original user's face, with no biometric data ever stored or transmitted.**

**We are seeking $80,000 in funding to expand our ZelfProof-powered password manager beyond the MVP, creating the most private and secure digital asset management solution on the Avalanche blockchain.**
